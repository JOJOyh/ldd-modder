# LDD Palette Maker
This tool will allow to create custom LDD palettes (box filter) and also extend predefined ones (customize default LDD palette).
LDD palettes allow to specify a quantity by brick, so it can act like a set.
This tool will use the Rebrickable API, and will allow to easily create palettes from set inventories or a user-list of bricks.
