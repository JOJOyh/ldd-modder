LDD Modding Tool
I am migrating an existing project from my private gitlab server to GitHub.
Instead of pushing to GitHub what's already developed, I created a new solution and project structure for cleaning and optimizing purposes.
So I'll be adding code chunks progressively as I redefine the workflow/code structure.

In case you're wondering, I have several custom bricks (only 2 for the moment :P ) in working order ready for use.
I'm currently elaborating a delivry/install procedure for custom bricks.
