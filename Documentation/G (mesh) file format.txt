### FILE START ###
Header 			=> 4 Bytes (always 31 30 47 42 ASCII = 10GB)
Vertex Count 	=> 4 Bytes (Integer)
Index Count 	=> 4 Bytes (Integer)
Mesh Type		=> 4 Bytes 
	- 3A standard mesh 
	- 3B textured mesh (surface)
	- 3E flexible mesh
	- 3F textured flexible mesh (surface)

### 3D DATA ###
# FOR 0 TO [Vertex Count] 
	Vertex 3D Point (X, Y, Z) => 12 Bytes (3 x Floats)
# FOR 0 TO [Vertex Count] 
	Normal 3D Point (X, Y, Z) => 12 Bytes (3 x Floats)

# IF Mesh Type == 3B OR Mesh Type == 3F
	# FOR 0 TO [Vertex Count] 
		Texture 2D Point => 8 Bytes (2 x Floats) (only for textured model)

### INDICES (TRIANGLES) ###
# FOR 0 TO [Index Count] / 3
	Triangle Index 1 => 4 Bytes (Integer)
	Triangle Index 2 => 4 Bytes (Integer)
	Triangle Index 3 => 4 Bytes (Integer)
	
### OUTLINE SHADER INFO ### 
Data Length 	=> 4 Bytes
Shader Data		=> [Data Length] * 4 Bytes (always referenced by steps of 12 (0x0C) but jumps by 16 every ??)
# Link shader data to indices (triangles)?
Indices 		=> [Index Count] * 4 Bytes

### UNKNOWN DATA 1 (JUNK?) ###
Data Length 		=> 4 Bytes
Unknown Data		=> [Data Length] * 12 Bytes
	|-> Header ?	=> 12 bytes (always 00 00 A6 42 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00)
	|-> 3D point ?	=> ([Data Size] - 1) * 12 Bytes 
	
# Link data to indices (triangles)?
Indices	=> [Index Count] * 4 Bytes (seems never used and sometimes contains xml chunks from the primitives file and not necessarily its own)


### FLEX DATA ##
# IF [Mesh Type] == 3E OR [Mesh Type] == 3F 
	[Data Length] => 4 bytes
	# FOR 0 TO [Vertex Count] 
		Number of pairs	=> 4 bytes
		# FOR 0 TO [Number of pairs]
			Flex Bone ID	=> 4 bytes (int)
			Bone Weight		=> 4 bytes (float)
			
	Offsets to each vertex => [Vertex Count] * 4 bytes

# MESH VARIATION WHEN CONNECTED TO OTHER BRICKS #
Number of variants => 4 Bytes (1 by default (base model), 1 for each stud + 1 for each stud connection "zone". not yet confirmed)
Data Length => 4 Bytes (equals offset to end of file)
# FOR 0 TO [Number of variants]
	Block size		=> 4 bytes (inclusive)
	Variant type	=> 4 bytes
		- Type 1: Stud Culling. Part of the mesh related to a stud is removed when under another brick (for performance maybe)
				  Seems to always be 44 bytes ([Block size])
		- Type 2: Not sure, seems to represent the default variant
			Spacing	=> 4 bytes
			Value 1 => 4 bytes (when only 1 variant, equals to [Vertex Count])
			Spacing	=> 4 bytes
			Value 2 => 4 bytes (when only 1 variant, equals to [Index Count])
			Spacing	=> 8 bytes
		- Type 4: 
		- Type 8: 
		

? number of Chunks of 28 bytes starting by 0x1C (28)

Variant Geometry Data # OPTIONAL ??
 |->Vertex Count => 4 Bytes (Integer)
 |->Index Count => 4 Bytes (Integer)
 |->vertices => [Vertex Count] * 12
 |->indices/triangle list => [Index Count] * 12
 |->indices/triangle list 2 => [Index Count] * 12
 |->indices/triangle list => [Index Count] * 12 (references outline shader data)
